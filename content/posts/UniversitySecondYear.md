# Second Year Complete 
Another academic year has come to a close and I have escaped with minimal damage. While there was a lot of work todo, I managed to get through it all and now have time to recover working on some of my own projects. Well that is what I would say if I didn't have an amazing opportunity lined up for next year. Starting just next month I will be taking on a year long placement at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en) as a programmer. This is going to be an amazing opportunity and a chance for me to learn even more than I already have, as well as put what I have learnt into practice within real life scenarios. 

Now that I have shared the good news I want to take some time to just talk about what my second year at university was like and without naming anything directly discuss why I think it could have been a lot better.

# Modules 
At the university I am attending a year is broken up into 2 different terms with each term having a maximum of 4 modules. Along with these modules being term based you can also have year long modules that spread across the 2 terms, these are less common though. Now the modules that I took this year were:
* Object Oriented Design
* Web Application Development
* Software and Security Management 
* Data Structures and Algorithms 
* Object Oriented Development 
* Concurrent and Parallel Algorithms
* Big Data and Machine Learning
* Agile Team Development 

As you can see there are a range of different modules each covering specific aspects of computer science. Object Oriented Design and Object Oriented Development both covered the Java programming language and focused on programming in an object oriented manner as well as design philosophy/patterns. Both modules were marked based on coursework. Web Application Development focused on PHP, going into the intricacies of the language. I was not the biggest fan of PHP, I feel like this is more due to the way the language was taught over the language itself. Software and Security Management was a bit of a weird module, it covered the different ways in which software buisnesses organised themselves and the methods in which programs were created (this included things like scrum meetings along with others). The module also briefly talked some of the tools that are normally used within companies, it mostly focused on git but only covered the basics leaving a lot for people to learn on the table.

Data Structures and Algorithms focused on the different ways of sorting numbers at first and then moved onto different ways of storing data. To do this it used the Java programming language and a lot of the module work focused on creating your own versions of already implemented versions of things like Hashmaps and Trees. Concurrent and Parallel Algorithms was said to be the continuation of Data Structures and Algorithms but in reality did not really have anything to do with the module. Concurrent and Parallel Algorithms focused on the logic behind creating parallel and concurrent algorithms with some examples, while some programs were created they were not what I would consider good examples of parallel programs. 

Big Data and Machine Learning was a very interesting module (also very relevant given what is currently going on in the world) and while the module itself did give me a greater understanding of machine learning and how big datasets are used to train the different models it was lacking in some of the more pratical aspects of it. A lot of the theory was taught but the actual programming apsects were just not there. Finally Agile Team Development module, this is the one module I was looking forward to out of all the ones however, it was the biggest letdown. Rather than actually being allowed to work in an agile way and develop the project that we wanted to, the module restricted you to following their worksheets to the letter with basically no creative freedom at all. 

# What I Took Away From This Year
This year of university showed me that my foundation of knowledge within Computer Science is actually a lot greater than I thought and now that I have a firm grasp on the fundamentals it is pretty easy to pick up other langauges. You hear it a lot when learning to program that the fundamentals are all that matter but it is really true. Each language has their own set of syntax rules and keywords but that is all that changes, a lot of the time these changes are not even that drastic. If you are learning to program or event want to start learning I would highly recommend teaching yourself the fundamentals of computer science and then pick a language to focus on, learn that language well and test yourself to create programs outside your comfort range. Once you have learnt that lanuage when you shift to another language you will pick it up a lot faster than you realise.

Another thin I have taken away from this year is my extreme dislike of GUIs, while I understand the need for graphical user interfaces (not everyone wants to do most of their work within the terminal) designing them myself is just not something I enjoy at all. Hopefully when I do get a job they will have a UI/UX team that can design everything allowing me to focus on the programming itself. My last big takeaway from this year is that not every language is made for everyone, sometimes you find yourself learning a language that you just cannot get into. For me that language is PHP, it just doesn't seem to click with me no matter how hard I try, I am sure one day I will comeback to it and try again but for now I am leaving this language in the rear view mirror.

# The Future
What is coming next, well as I said at the top of this post I have managed to get a placement year at IBM as a programmer. I am really looking forward to it and it isn't even that long till I start, for a while at university I felt like I wasn't being tested or pushed to my limits but I am sure that will change the moment I start working. Along with this placement year of course I have my own projects, the PokeDex project is still something I am working on and am looking to have a fully working version (for testing at the very least) done by the end of the year. Currently for the PokeDex project I am trying to figure out how I am going to get all the different moves, items and pokemon themselves into the programing in a semi automated way (I am not typing in all that information by hand), if you have any suggestions please let me know.

And of course I am going to be doing this, keeping a sort of bi-monthly log of projects, updates and other assortment of things. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you have a great day.
