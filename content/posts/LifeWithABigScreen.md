# Introduction
Samsung introduced their latest folding phone to the masses on ... and it was not that much of an improvement on what they had previously offered with their Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 (referred to as Fold 3 and Fold 4 respectively from here on out). In fact while Samsung said that the device was slightly smaller and wider you could not tell the difference unless the 2 devices were side by side. A lot of tech reviewers mentioned that for people who owned the Fold 3 they could skip this generation but what about those of us who couldn't afford a Fold 3 at the time? Should we now look to pull the trigger on our folding desires?

Well, I cannot tell you whether this device is right for you but, what I can do is walk you through just how incredible this phone has been in the few months that I have had the device since its launch. Here are my thoughts on the device, the good, the bad and the needlessly stupid design decisions made by Samsung.

Before reading ahead I just want to preface this by saying that I did not own a Fold 3 or a Flip 3, all comparisons made to the Fold 4 will be from my perspective of having used a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra since its launch. With all the warnings out of the way lets get into the nitty gritty.

## Crease
I'm going to start with the crease, from a lot of the videos that I have watched online about the Fold 3 people seemed to dislike the crease Samsung is implementing on their folding line of phones when compared to something like the Razer's and Oppo Find N's of the world. Samsung appears to be using this narrow radius fold as it is the only one they have been able to waterproof. Watching a lot of videos about the different foldable phones you will see that when the Razer phone folds the screen lifts up from the body a little bit and then morphs into a tear drop shape as which point the phone is closed. Compare this to the Fold 4 where the screen stays pretty much where it is as the phone folds and you can work out that this was needed in order to give the phone a waterproof raiting. Rating a phone for waterproofing, while does give the consumer piece of mind, is not something that altogether makes a big diffence. When it becomes possible for the other folding form factors to be waterproofed I am sure Samsung will move their design over.

Another thing that Samsung does different from their current competition is the material they use for their folding display, rather than using a plastic composite they are using an ultra thin glass. While I am not brave enough to remove the factory screen protect currently applied to my Fold 4 there are people who have done it but I don't see the point when it feels no different from using a normal phone out of the gate. For now I do not see the crease as an issue and my device has not sustained any damage but I will keep you updated.

Crease is there, you can feel it when you move your fingers across it and at certain angles of light it becomes clearly apparent that it is there but for general every day use it is not something I found distracting at all. Looking dead at the phone the crease is not something you can see at all. If you are looking at the crease through images and videos online I can say not that it is making it seem a lot worse than it looks in real life. If your geographical location allows you go and look at a Fold 4 in Samsung Store and you will see what I mean. 

## Display
Using a device that has such a large display is amazing and something that helps sell the size of this incredible canvas is the inclusion of an under display camera (UDC). Does the quality come at a compromise, yes. But it really does help when you are looking at content to make it feel more immersive and other than playing with the feature when I first got the phone I have not used the UDC at all. Maybe if I was someone who took more video calls it would see more use but when I am able to use the main cameras to take all my photos I do not know why I would use it. Now I cannot say that if the quality was better it would see more use but as it stands Samsung could remove the camera all together and it would not affect me. 

Some people do not like the fact that the camera is under the display and if you would rather have a hole punch camera cut out in your phone then you can do that by installing GoodLock (a Samsung app that allows you to custimise your galaxy device a little more) to change a few settings. As it stands though I am happy that Samsung included a UDC in its device as until now the only one I had seen was in a TCL phone, if the big players in the game (the Samsung, Google's and Apple's of the world) start using this technology then more companies are going to adopt it into their phones which causes the development cycle of the tech to increase. While the UDC is okay at best and abomadable at worst improvements within that area now that Samsung are actively working on it are sure to come.

Problem with that inside screen though is just how large it is. Now I know this is kind of controversal but when you think about it due to the screens size the default keyboard is split across the 2 halves of the phone. This is an issue because I reach over the center line when I am typing a lot which you basically cannot do on a split keyboard. Splitting the keyboard is not the end of the world, I found that after about 2 months of using the device I was close to my normaly typing speed but my accuracy definately fell. This is another thing that I will keep you updated on as I use the device as part of my every day life. 

Outside of the giant folding screen is a much smaller cover screen that is surprisingly usable. Along with a lot of people I wondered why Samsung couldn't just have a normal sized display as the cover screen and a larger screen on the inside. Yes, doing it this way would result in the inside screen being larger but that is kind of the whole point in getting this phone. Normaly phone for general tasks and a tablet sized screen when you need it. However, I can see now why Samsung did things this way. When I am out and about using the outside screen is so simple, one handed use was clearly what Samsung was thinking and they have achieved it. Even with the size of the device being what it is I have not dropped the phone once, swipe typing (while not my favourite way to type on a phone) works reliably and my thumb is able to reach across the entire screen (that might just be because I have rather large hands though so your milage may vary).

## S-Pen
Fold 3 introduced a folding screen that was able to use an S-Pen allowing all of the note users, who thought that Samsung had abandoned them now that the S line of phones was getting features previously only for note phones, to transition over to the fold. Why did it take it now then for me to switch over to the fold then? One element was price which I will talk about more later and the second part is that it had not been throughly tested. I am one of the people who likes looking at the bleeding edge but will often get something that has been tried and tested. Using a stylus on Samsungs folding ultra thin glass screens just hadn't been put through its paces yet.

Looking back I had nothing to worry about and could have pulled the trigger to buy the previous model of the fold but I am also glad that I didn't get the previous model as even now using the S-Pen with the fold seems half baked. S-Pen now comes in 2 additions: S-Pen Fold and S-Pen Fold Pro (as of writing this I have not been able to get my hands on an S-Pen Fold Pro as they are out of stock everywhere or cost a lot more than they should). As I only have the S-Pen Fold I am only able to comment on what I think about this specific version and it has not faired well. Using the stylus on the display is incredible and feels just as good as writing on an iPad, just without the sort of writing software that you would use on the iPad. Digitiser that Samsung is using and is made by Wacom is actually to separate digitisers that are linked together in software. Software being used is clever it has made some mistakes when crossing over the boundary from one side of the screen to the other. Another issues is that it seems to get the pressure I am applying while writing all wrong making it seems as if I am pressing too hard one moment then not pressing at all. 

![Photo S-Pen on its Own, Outside of Case](/images/posts/LifeBigScreen/05S-Pen.png)

Something else to take into consideration is that the Fold edition of the S-Pen does not have a built in battery so the phone only know you are using it when it actually comes into contact with the display and can send a signal. This edition of the S-Pen is also just not as feature rich as the pro version, you can write on the screen and that is pretty much it. If I can get an S-Pen Pro I will let you know what it is like but at the moment it seems rather unlikely.

S-Pen with the note devices was useful because they gave the pen somewhere to live on device, because it was always with you I used it so much more. In comparision if you get the S-Pen for you fold you either need to get a bulky case to store it or just remember to bring it with you. I opted to get a case and because I can always feel it I do use the pen but it adds bulk onto what was already not the thinnest smartphone in the world. What it seems like happened is that Samsung wanted to be able to say that you could use the S-Pen on the device but given how they implemented it they probably should have waited a few versions. Hopefully Samsung can get it to the point that the S-Pen can be stored within the device and even charge inside the device like the notes so we can get back all the features, this just seems like wishful thinking though. It seems more likely that Samsung will keep it how it is, making consumers pay more for a feature that used to come as stock.

## Software
Android is not optimised in any way for folding phones (or at least it wasn't until Android L) but the work that Samsung has done with their Android skin makes it work surprisingly well. Now do not get me wrong some apps ('cough' Instagram) do not want to operate on this screen, but then again unless you are running an iPhone Instagram is always complaining, Samsung thought of this though allowing you to force apps into different aspect ratios where you see fit. For the apps that I do use everyday there has been very little to complain about, expect WhatsApp doing this weird split screen thing rather than having separate columns like some other apps.

![WhatsApp Weird Columns State](/images/posts/LifeBigScreen/07WhatsAppScreenShot.png)

This is only the 4th generation that Samsung has been playing with the folding form factor but it still seems like they have a long way to go with the software, it is not only Samsungs fault though. 

First off I would like to know why I need 2 message apps installed by default? Both Samsung messages and Google messages are installed by default and it is Google messages that the system uses. Of course I should be allowed to install a third party texting app but I just do not understand why I need both of them on there when I first start up the phone it seems counter productive. Of course Samsung wants me to use their messaging app but then why does the OS default to using Google messages? It just seems a little strange.

Another annoying things is the default apps that Samsung has installed on all of their devices. Things like calendar, calculator and clock are all there, now it is not them being installed by default that I have a problem with it is the fact that I cannot uninstalled or even disable them. I understand having these apps installed as some people will obviously prefer them to alternatives out there but why can I not disable them? Every app (unless it is truely integral to the phones operation) should be able to be disables within the settings, there is just no reason for them not to be able to.

![Running 2 Apps Side by Side](/images/posts/LifeBigScreen/08TwoAppsSideBySide.png)

My little rant out of the way now we can move onto the good stuff. Want to run 2 apps at the same time, go for it (you can even run 3 and have a floating app if you feel like it). Watching something and want the biggest viewing possible on a phone, here you go. Reading a book on Kindle or indulging in some FanFiction (you know who you are), I have not found a better device. A retro gamer who needs to get a fix while on the move, RetroArch on the Fold works amazingly well and if you pair a controller then it just gets better.

Compared to what I have seen from people who owned the Fold 2 and Fold 3 the software experience on the 4 has been polished a lot more. Yes there are some things that do not function (some apps just do not seem to rescale when going from the small screen to the big screen, looking at you YouTube) but there are small hiccups on all devices, for the positives that this device gives they are not bad enough for me to mark the experience down.


# Samsung Bonuses
Whether due to the price of the Fold or because Samsung feels like being generous (probably the former) they seem to offer insentives for people to buy the phone. While I feel like these offerings will not convince people who had not intentions of getting the phone to get it, they might pursuade some people who were on the fence about it. 

As I pre-ordered the device there are a few extra bits that I got but from what I can see on Samsungs website at the moment (subject to change over time) they are still offering all of the things that I got with my device. So far I have got what Samsung calls the 'Note Taking Pack' which includes their 'Standing Cover with Pen' and a 'Fast Charger'. We could debate all day as to why Samsung called the charger a 'fast' charger when other companies leave the Folds charging rate in the dust but it is still nice that I was able to get one considering it didn't come in the box with the device.

![Samsung Note Taking Pack on the Device](/images/posts/LifeBigScreen/09SamsungNoteTakingPack.png)

Also recently I was able to claim a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2 Pro but they can take up to 45 days to ship so your milage may vary with that.

It is nice, as I said before, of Samsung to include these things but I cannot help but winder why they are doing it. Surely if they are able to offer consumers these addons they could afford to lower the price of the phone just a little bit. Doing a small amount of maths shows that the items I have claimed so far come to a combined price of around £300. Could or should Samsung have just knocked £300 off the price of the phone maybe but if they did that and removed the insentives would as many people buy the device? That is not a question I can answer unfortunately.

# Bending Both Ways
Fold 4 is an amazing device but unfortunately it is not all good. Starting with the price, at £1800 it is probably the most expensive phone people would actually consider buying (I am not counting some of those weird phones that include like part of the moon because they are just strange). For something that costs so much there shouldn't really be any negatives to the experience but, with peoples devices breaking all over Reddit whether due to the UTG (ultra thing glass) or a problem out of the factory it is just not something that the end user should have to put up with at this price point. 

Another downside is battery life, it is so hard to converve battery usage when the bigger inside screen is just so inviting. I have found myself using my phone more and more for writing documents, gamaing and watching videos which obviously takes its toll on the battery. Hopefully next generation Samsung can find some way of putting a bigger battery into the device or just optimising how the battery 'AI' they have utalises it.

And lastly is just the feeling that I have to be super careful with the device. When I look back on how I have used the device over the past few months I see that I have not done half the things that I would have done with my old phone. The only time I have thrown the device is onto my bed where I know there is a mattress to cushion its landing. Durability of the Fold 4 is a lot better than the first fold and all the problems that came with just a spec of dust but it is still something that you have to be careful with when using in every day life. Hopefully my Fold will last a long time (3 year if possible) but only time will tell and of course I will keep you updated all the way.

# Conclusion
Even with all of the downsides the Fold 4 is something that I am going to be keeping. Just using the device brings a simle to my face every time. Having the ability to use my phone normally and have a tablet when I want it is just something I cannot give up now that I have experienced it.

I understand that this device is not for everyone but I think over time as the technology behind it becomes better it will become more widely adopted. Thank you for reading.
