# Introduction
Samsung introduced their latest folding phone to the masses on ... and it was not that much of an improvement on what they had previously offered with their Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 (referred to as Fold 3 and Fold 4 respectively from here on out). In fact while Samsung said that the device was slightly smaller and wider you could not tell the difference unless the 2 devices were side by side. A lot of tech reviewers mentioned that for people who owned the Fold 3 they could skip this generation but what about those of us who couldn't afford a Fold 3 at the time? Should we now look to pull the trigger on our folding desires?

Well, I cannot tell you whether this device is right for you but, what I can do is walk you through just how incredible this phone has been in the few months that I have had the device since its launch. Here are my thoughts on the device, the good, the bad and the needlessly stupid design decisions made by Samsung.

Before reading ahead I just want to preface this by saying that I did not own a Fold 3 or a Flip 3, all comparisons made to the Fold 4 will be from my perspective of having used a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra since its launch. With all the warnings out of the way lets get into the nitty gritty.

## Crease
I'm going to start with the crease, from a lot of the videos that I have watched online about the Fold 3 people seemed to dislike the crease Samsung is implementing on their folding line of phones when compared to something like the Razer's and Oppo Find N's of the world. Samsung appears to be using this narrow radius fold as it is the only one they have been able to waterproof. Watching a lot of videos about the different foldable phones you will see that when the Razer phone folds the screen lifts up from the body a little bit and then morphs into a tear drop shape as which point the phone is closed. Compare this to the Fold 4 where the screen stays pretty much where it is as the phone folds and you can work out that this was needed in order to give the phone a waterproof raiting. Rating a phone for waterproofing, while does give the consumer piece of mind, is not something that altogether makes a big diffence. When it becomes possible for the other folding form factors to be waterproofed I am sure Samsung will move their design over.

Another thing that Samsung does different from their current competition is the material they use for their folding display, rather than using a plastic composite they are using an ultra thin glass. While I am not brave enough to remove the factory screen protect currently applied to my Fold 4 there are people who have done it but I don't see the point when it feels no different from using a normal phone out of the gate. For now I do not see the crease as an issue and my device has not sustained any damage but I will keep you updated.

Crease is there, you can feel it when you move your fingers across it and at certain angles of light it becomes clearly apparent that it is there but for general every day use it is not something I found distracting at all. Looking dead at the phone the crease is not something you can see at all. If you are looking at the crease through images and videos online I can say not that it is making it seem a lot worse than it looks in real life. If your geographical location allows you go and look at a Fold 4 in Samsung Store and you will see what I mean. 

## Display
Using a device that has such a large display is amazing and something that helps sell the size of this incredible canvas is the inclusion of an under display camera (UDC). Does the quality come at a compromise, yes. But it really does help when you are looking at content to make it feel more immersive and other than playing with the feature when I first got the phone I have not used the UDC at all. Maybe if I was someone who took more video calls it would see more use but when I am able to use the main cameras to take all my photos I do not know why I would use it. Now I cannot say that if the quality was better it would see more use but as it stands Samsung could remove the camera all together and it would not affect me. 

Some people do not like the fact that the camera is under the display and if you would rather have a hole punch camera cut out in your phone then you can do that by installing GoodLock (a Samsung app that allows you to custimise your galaxy device a little more) to change a few settings. As it stands though I am happy that Samsung included a UDC in its device as until now the only one I had seen was in a TCL phone, if the big players in the game (the Samsung, Google's and Apple's of the world) start using this technology then more companies are going to adopt it into their phones which causes the development cycle of the tech to increase. While the UDC is okay at best and abomadable at worst improvements within that area now that Samsung are actively working on it are sure to come.

Problem with that inside screen though is just how large it is. Now I know this is kind of controversal but when you think about it due to the screens size the default keyboard is split across the 2 halves of the phone. This is an issue because I reach over the center line when I am typing a lot which you basically cannot do on a split keyboard. Splitting the keyboard is not the end of the world, I found that after about 2 months of using the device I was close to my normaly typing speed but my accuracy definately fell. This is another thing that I will keep you updated on as I use the device as part of my every day life. 

Outside of the giant folding screen is a much smaller cover screen that is surprisingly usable. Along with a lot of people I wondered why Samsung couldn't just have a normal sized display as the cover screen and a larger screen on the inside. Yes, doing it this way would result in the inside screen being larger but that is kind of the whole point in getting this phone. Normaly phone for general tasks and a tablet sized screen when you need it. However, I can see now why Samsung did things this way. When I am out and about using the outside screen is so simple, one handed use was clearly what Samsung was thinking and they have achieved it. Even with the size of the device being what it is I have not dropped the phone once, swipe typing (while not my favourite way to type on a phone) works reliably and my thumb is able to reach across the entire screen (that might just be because I have rather large hands though so your milage may vary).
