# Galaxy Unpacked
Wednesday 10th August 2022 Samsung held their big event, Galaxy Unpacked, where they announced a total of 5 new devices. Out of these 5 new devices the big one for me is of the folding variety. This post is not about all of the devices that Samsung announced at the event but I am going to quickly go over them here.

## Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 and Watch 5 Pro
Galaxy Watch 5 is the latest wearable from Samsung and is their second generation smart watch that is running the new 'Wear OS' which they have created in collaboration with Google. Some small changes have been made to the design of the watch with it now coming in 3 different sizes (40, 44, 45) with the largest size, 45mm, only being available on the Pro varient of the watch. I think this is better than the 4 different sizes (40, 42, 44, 46) Samsung had last year with their watches but for those who liked larger watches the 46mm will be missed.

All watches do come in varients that support both Bluetooth (BT) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) however prices vary with which one you choose.

Infrared temperature sensor has been added to the new Samsung smart watches which will most likely be used to help improve how the Samsung Health app monitors your workouts and heart rate. Battery inside the Galaxy Watch 5 is also 15% bigger than in last years model and has been rated for up to 50 hours of battery life, with the Galaxy Watch 5 Pro being rated for 80 hours. Take these numbers with a grain of salt though as real world tests have not yet been conducted outside of Samsung. 

## Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro
These new earphones from Samsung have a slight redesign from their younger counter parts ditching the glossy look for what seems to be matt black. They also come with '24bit Hi-Fi sound' according to Samsung but whether this makes a difference to the average listener sound quality depends on whether the audio your playing supports it. 360 degree sounds and a new intelligent ANC have also been included with the ear buds. 

The cases also now match the colour of the earbuds, why this wasn't a thing before I do not know. Price for these new Samsung buds at (at least in the UK) is £219.

## Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4
