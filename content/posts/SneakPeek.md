# I'm Back To Posting
Sorry for not posting for a while but university and life got a bit hectic all of a sudden, something things just be like that. Unfortunately my post schedule of once per month seems a bit optimistic at the moment with everything going on so I am planning to cut down just a little bit. Rather than posting once a month I am planning to post once every other month, this should give me sometime to hopefully sort things out but also to spend more time working on the projects that I am hoping to write about. 

# Other Quick News
One of many reasons that I have not been posting is that I am in what I would class as the late game for my second year at university, with 2 tests just round the corner and 3 pieces of coursework that are due as well there is a lot to be getting on with but by around May time that should all be done and out of the way allowing me to spend more time working on these passion projects. Another big piece of news is that I am going to be starting a placement soon. As part of my university course I have the option to spend a year working in industry to further develop my skills and also spend time putting into practice what I have only been shown at university. I am quite excited and while I am not going to say much now down the line I am hoping to write a short post about where I am working and what I am working on (if they allow me to).

# What is Coming
Now while I have been away I have not been idly sitting by, there is quite a big project that I have been working on involving Pokemon. The image below is a small UML that I have created showing the backend of the program that I have been working on. The front end designs are not quite done yet but I am hoping that I will have finalised them all by the next time I post. Then it is off to work on the program.

Along with this there are some others, as I am also planning on going through the coursework that I had to complete for one of my programming dirven modules and also make some imporvements to that I think is a flawed application. There are so many things I would like to do, including finally finish AdventOfCode 2022. Watch this space over the coming months because ther eis a lot that I would like to do and I am going to be dedicating time to doing it.

Thank you for reading and hopefully catch you in the future.
